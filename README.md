## About Me
A passionate software developer with a deep-rooted love for technology and continuous learning. Hailing from the heart of India, Madhya Pradesh, I graduated from the Indore Institute of Science and Technology with a degree in Computer Science. With over 1+ years of professional experience, my expertise lies in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Blockchain Development, particularly in public EVM-based chains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Tron, Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon, and Enterprise Blockchain like Xinfin.

I shine in smart contract development, boasting hands-on experience in writing and auditing smart contracts. Proficient in tools like Hardhat for deployment and testing, I've seamlessly integrated smart contracts with front-end applications using ethers.js and possess familiarity with React.js.

Beyond professional endeavors, I'm committed to nurturing the next generation of Blockchain enthusiasts, having mentored and taught over 100 students. Currently seeking freelancing opportunities in DeFi, Blockchain Development, NFTs, ERC tokens, and smart contract auditing, I'm open to collaboration and discussions.

In the ever-evolving Blockchain landscape, I'm not only establishing a vibrant web3 community in Indore but also expanding my skills to include Rust, Substrate Parachains, and TypeScript. Recently, I undertook a project involving token migration from Ethereum to a Substrate-based Relaychain, showcasing my versatility.

Now, in a new chapter of my journey, I'm diving into the captivating realm of quantitative finance through a dedicated program at WQU. My interests span across technology, finance, mathematics, spirituality, politics, and travel â€“ a jumbo pack of diverse passions!

Excited to connect, learn, and share experiences with this vibrant community. Thanks for having me here!
