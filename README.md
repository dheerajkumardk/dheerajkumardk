### About Me

Hello! 👋 I'm Dheeraj, a passionate blockchain developer and smart contract auditor with a love for continuous learning and innovation. My journey in the Web3 space has been fueled by curiosity and the drive to contribute to decentralized ecosystems.

### Expertise:

- **Blockchain Development:** Experienced in EVM-based public chains like Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon. Proficient in smart contract development using Solidity with a focus on DeFi, NFTs, and token standards (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155).

- **Smart Contract Auditing:** Practicing smart contract security and participating in audit contests on platforms like CodeHawks. Skilled in identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring robustness.
  Experienced with advanced tools like Certora for formal verification, Halmos for runtime monitoring, and implementing fuzzing tests for comprehensive security coverage.

- **Tools & Frameworks:** Hands-on with Hardhat, Foundry, and ethers.js for development, testing, and integration.

### Recent Ventures:

- **Freelance Projects:** Worked on DAOs, flash loan protocols, token swaps, stablecoin systems, and Uniswap v3 integration.

- **Learning & Teaching:** Expanding expertise in blockchain security and contributing to the ecosystem through mentorship and knowledge sharing.

- **Quantitative Finance:** Exploring the intersection of blockchain and finance through a master's program at WQU, focusing on financial engineering.

### Beyond Work:

When not immersed in code, I delve into spirituality, travel, and exploring political and economic systems. Let's build, learn, and innovate together in this incredible Web3 journey!

Feel free to connect and collaborate – always open to exciting projects and discussions! 🚀
